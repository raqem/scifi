 <h3> Book One: Fireflies and Cosmos </h3>

  <img src="./images/FandC.jpg">

 <p> <strong>C</strong>aptain Catalina Solaris Xao Mondragon has a problem. If the Artemis is to continue its work of upholding the Charter and providing colonists of the 51 Seeded Worlds with help terraforming and stabilizing their still young ecosystems, she'll need to replace her entomologist. The problem is that the only bug-guy Catalina has ever met who is skilled enough to work on her ship is her ex-boyfriend, and he has the infuriating habit of falling in love and seducing a different woman on every planet he goes to. </p>
 <p><strong>I</strong>f Catalina hopes to figure out what the hell the creatures were that devoured her last entomologist, Roman Jupiter is her best bet, and surely a few bruised feelings are worth a planet? Catalina thinks its worth the risk, even if her crew of interstellar ecologists have other feelings about Jupiter and his lousy poetry.</p>

 <img src="./images/DandM.jpg">

 <p> <strong>I</strong>n episode two of Interstellar Spring, Captain Catalina Solaris Xao Mondragon and her crew of Interstellar Ecologists are called upon to save a planet from an infestation of mutant crabs intent on eating every drop of carbon they can find, even if itâ€™s inside of living people. <br> <br><strong>D</strong>iamondcrabs and Mangoes picks up right where Fireflies and Cosmos leaves off, with the Artemis answering a distress call to save the planet, Juxor, from a plague of flesh-eating crabs. Catalina and her crew hope to solve the problem quickly, but things get out of hand as the crabs' strange powers overwhelm even the crew of the mighty Artemis. While Ikamon and Roman work to understand the crabs, Farah explores part of Juxor and meets the woman in charge of the planet's strange rituals govern who works and who breeds on this watery world. With Ikamon missing his wife and Roman distracted by a beautiful doctor, Osha McKenna, will our Interstellar Ecologists be able to save Juxor and the oceans of carbon-rich sludge they export to the rest of the Seeded Worlds? Find out in Diamondcrabs and Mangoes! </p>
